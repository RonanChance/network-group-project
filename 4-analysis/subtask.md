#### SUBTASK 4, Analysis (max 12 points):
This subtask involves generating statistics to understand the data and identify useful insights. It could involve presenting relevant summary statistics of the dataset. Additionally, summarizing membership of nodes and links and identifying various network phenomena (e.g., hubs, small worlds) and emphasizing important characteristics (e.g., heterogeneous distribution of node/link properties) of the network.

##### Grading rubric
* Analyses was provided to understand the composition of dataset
* Analyses was provided to address relevant research questions
* Analysis is sound and code provided for computing metrics. Documented (comments and Readmes) Python scripts (not Notebooks) were used. Code is modular (uses separate files/functions) and reusable (no hard-coding). 
* Report includes problem summary/questions, code snippets, and is clearly written: well-organized and includes few typos/grammatical errors
