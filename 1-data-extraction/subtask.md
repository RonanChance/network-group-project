#### SUBTASK 1, Data extraction/cleaning (max 12 points):
This subtask involves extracting the data - the raw material needed to address the project goals. This could also involve cleanup/transformation of the data, deciding what to collect (sample) and what to exclude (ensure to include in report) and saving the data into a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

##### Grading rubric
* Complete network dataset was downloaded
* Dataset includes fields pertinent to address research questions
* Dataset is human/machine-readable and well-organized
* Data extraction was implemented in documented (comments and ReadMes) Python scripts (not Notebooks). Code for generating dataset is modular (uses separate files/functions) and reusable (no hard-coding). 
* Report includes problem summary/questions, code snippets, and is clearly written: well-organized and includes few typos/grammatical errors
