#### SUBTASK 3, Visualization (max 12 points):
This subtask involves implementing a network visualization with Gephi, Networkx, D3 or another instructor-approved tool to visualize the project network. This involves deciding the best way to visualize the network. For example, deciding the network layout (e.g., force-directed vs. circular), color scheme (e.g., color-blind friendly), and what attributes to map to channel (e.g., size, position).

##### Grading rubric
* Network visualization is legible and helps explore/understand various network phenomena
* Network visualization was implemented in documented (comments and ReadMes) Python scripts (not Notebooks). Code is modular (uses separate files/functions) and reusable (no hard-coding). 
* Report includes problem summary/questions, code snippets, and is clearly written: well-organized and includes few typos/grammatical errors
