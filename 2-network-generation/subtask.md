#### SUBTASK 2, Network generation (max 12 points):
This subtask requires transforming the data into a network model involving nodes and links to model relationships. This includes deciding what relationships to model and how (e.g., (un)directed vs. (un)weighted) to represent them.

##### Grading rubric
* Network model is capable of addressing research questions
* Reasonable justifications are provided for network generation decisions
* Network generation was implemented in documented (comments and ReadMes) Python scripts (not Notebooks). Code is modular (uses separate files/functions) and reusable (no hard-coding). 
* Report includes problem summary/questions, code snippets, and is clearly written: well-organized and includes few typos/grammatical errors
